Main thing is keep it in air, not water, but with 100% saturation.\nThen calibrate % saturated DO. \n\n### Conductivity\nBest to calibrate to standard higher than values we measure, thus 10,00 uS is probably best for us\nCan order from Fondriest: https://www.fondriest.com/fondriest-environmental-10000-us-conductivity-standards.htm\n \nPut standard in graduated cylinder\nSubmerge probe deep enough to ensure side vent holes are filled\nMay have to knock air bubbles out of holes, so may need to give it a little tap\nDo a one point calibration. When uS value stabilizes, enter uS value.\nCalibrate on specific conductivity \n\n",
