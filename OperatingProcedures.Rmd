## Storage
For short term storage (i.e. during the field season when it is frequently used), just keep a moist sponge in the grey sleeve (No need to keep the red cover in place)
For long-term storage, can use the red sleeve with moist sponge

## Calibration
### DO
Generally always keep the probe guard on  
Calibrate by putting moist sponge in bottom of grey sleeve (donâ€™t use red cover because it can create a negative pressure)  
Key = create a non pressurized moist environment.   
Alternatively, could wrap a wet paper towel around the probe guard. Main thing is keep it in air, not water, but with 100% saturation.  
Then calibrate % saturated DO. 

### Conductivity
Best to calibrate to standard higher than values we measure, thus 10,00 uS is probably best for us
Can order from Fondriest: https://www.fondriest.com/fondriest-environmental-10000-us-conductivity-standards.htm
 
Put standard in graduated cylinder
Submerge probe deep enough to ensure side vent holes are filled
May have to knock air bubbles out of holes, so may need to give it a little tap
Do a one point calibration. When uS value stabilizes, enter uS value.
Calibrate on specific conductivity
